
PREPROCESSING

1. Residualize datasets (differential_abundance/src/test_DA.R)
2. Run HAllA (Dropbox/analysis/mechanistic_correlations/halla_runs*.sh)
3. Run network scripts (mechanistic_correlations/src/cytoscape.jl) for both full and empty models

IMPORT TO CYTOSCAPE

1. Create a new network
2. File > Import > Network > File...
   Import the edges.tsv file (use defaults)
3. File > Import > Table > File...
   Import the nodes.tsv file (use defaults)

MAIN NETWORK FIGURE

1. Select "interesting_connections_1side"
2. Select > Nodes > Nodes connected by selected edges
3. File > New > Network > From selected nodes, selected edges
4. Layout > Perfuse Force-Directed Layout > (none)
5. Remove smaller components
6. Arrange network to final layout
7. Theme should be HMP2-nolabels
8. Select "hubs"
9. Set node bypasses for:
   - Size: 45
   - Border Paint: Black
   - Border Width: 8
10. Export as PDF
11. Node names are added in Inkscape

SPECIES SUB-NETWORK

1. Select "subdoli_faecali"
2. First neighbors of selected nodes
3. New network from selected nodes
4. Layout > Perfuse Force-Directed Layout > (none)
5. Trim cruft and tweak layout
6. Set style "HMP2-main-w-labels"

HIGHLIGHT NETWORKS

1. Set style to "HMP2-highlight"
2. Select nodes of interest (filters: "carnitines", "bile_acids", "LPE_MAG")
3. Set color bypass to green and size to 70
