The files in this location contain code used to perform the analysis depicted in
Figure 4 of the manuscript supplied by Zhou et al. (NCOMMS_19_01111_T). 

There are two directories in this location: 

data
----
 Contains the input data for this analysis. 

src
---
 Contains the code for this analysis. Files were run as follows: 
 
 1) prepare-dataset.R 
    Reads in flat files containing input data, then generates a single R file
    contiaining cytokine + host data for each of the three cytokines of 
    interest (IL17A, IL17F, IL22). 

 2) pipeline_glmm.py
    This script splits the processed input data into cytokines + genus pairs 
    so that models can be run in an embarassingly paralell manner. 

 3) run_glmm.R
    This script is called by pipeline_glmm.py. It contains R code for running
     the Bayesian mixed-effects model described in the manuscript.
